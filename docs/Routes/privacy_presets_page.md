# `GET /admin/root/privacy-presets`

Shows the privacy presets, the one applied, its drift and its checklist

Root only. The preset applied — or none — with the settings that differ from it, Re-apply and Detach, a newer version of it when there is one (never applied by itself), its controller checklist (the items about the agent only while it is on; nothing records whether one is done), every preset with Preview, Export and Delete, and the forms that save the current settings as a preset and import one. notice, preset and reason tell the outcome of the last action.

## Try it

Only what is required:

```bash
curl localhost:3000/admin/root/privacy-presets
```

With every value it reads:

```bash
curl 'localhost:3000/admin/root/privacy-presets?notice=my-notice&preset=my-preset&reason=my-reason&lang=my-lang' \
  -H 'x-client-ip: my-x-client-ip' \
  -H 'x-forwarded-for: my-x-forwarded-for' \
  -H 'x-client-port: my-x-client-port' \
  -H 'x-request-method: my-x-request-method' \
  -H 'origin: my-origin' \
  -H 'host: my-host' \
  -b 'backoffice_language=my-backoffice-language'
```

Any route may also answer `404`, `405` or `500`: see [when something goes wrong](doc.md#when-something-goes-wrong).

## Runs first

These routes run before this one, on the same request. Any of them may refuse it — with `401`
or `403`, for example — or let it through to this route.

| Route | When |
| --- | --- |
| [`backoffice-client-ip`](backoffice_client_ip.md) | always |
| [`backoffice-language`](backoffice_language.md) | always |
| [`backoffice-maintenance`](backoffice_maintenance.md) | always |
| [`backoffice-root-guard`](backoffice_root_guard.md) | always |
| [`backoffice-same-origin`](backoffice_same_origin.md) | always |
| [`backoffice-security-headers`](backoffice_security_headers.md) | always |
| [`backoffice-session-auth`](backoffice_session_auth.md) | depends on the address — `explain-route` gives the exact answer |
| [`ip-blocker`](ip_blocker.md) | always |
