# `POST /api/admin/root/remove-ip-blocks`

Removes IP blocks

Root only. ids are the ids of the blocks, at most 100. Answers {removed}; ids no block holds are skipped, and none found answers 404.

## Try it

Only what is required:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/admin/root/remove-ip-blocks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ids":[1]}'
```

With every value it reads:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/admin/root/remove-ip-blocks \
  -H 'authorization: my-authorization' \
  -H 'x-client-ip: my-x-client-ip' \
  -H 'x-forwarded-for: my-x-forwarded-for' \
  -H 'x-client-port: my-x-client-port' \
  -H 'x-request-method: my-x-request-method' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ids":[1]}'
```

More examples:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/admin/root/remove-ip-blocks -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"ids":[1,2]}'
```

## Query string, headers and cookies

| Name | Sent in | What goes there | Required | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authorization` | header | text | no | `my-authorization` | an API token created on /admin/list-backoffice-api-tokens, as Bearer <token> — read by [`backoffice-api-token-auth`](backoffice_api_token_auth.md), which runs first |
| `x-client-ip` | header | text | no | `my-x-client-ip` | the ip of the connection, set by the server and never by the client — read by [`backoffice-client-ip`](backoffice_client_ip.md), which runs first |
| `x-forwarded-for` | header | text | no | `my-x-forwarded-for` | the client chain a reverse proxy appended to, read only with --allow-x-forwarded-for — read by [`backoffice-client-ip`](backoffice_client_ip.md), which runs first |
| `x-client-port` | header | text | no | `my-x-client-port` | the source port of the visitor's connection, set by the server and never by the client — or by the reverse proxy start-server trusts with --client-port-header — read by [`backoffice-client-ip`](backoffice_client_ip.md), which runs first |
| `x-request-method` | header | text | no | `my-x-request-method` | the method of the request, set by the server and never by the client — read by [`backoffice-maintenance`](backoffice_maintenance.md), which runs first |

These routes run before this one, on the same request. Any of them may refuse it — with `401`
or `403`, for example — or let it through to this route.
